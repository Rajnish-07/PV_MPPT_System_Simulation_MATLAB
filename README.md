# PV_MPPT_System_Simulation_MATLAB
Solar radiation and temperature are the main factor for which the electric power supplied by a photovoltaic system varies. The voltage at which PV module can produce maximum power is called ‘maximum power point’ (or peak power voltage).The main principle of MPPT is responsible for extracting the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic and feed it to the load via dc to dc converter which steps up/steps down the voltage to required magnitude. Various MPPT techniques have been used in past but Perturb & Observe (P&O) algorithm is most widely accepted.
